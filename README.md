CollectiveAccess is free, open-source software for cataloguing and publishing museum and archival collections. We are currently evaluating and configuring the application for the INBO collections (https://www.gbif.org/grscicoll/institution/df2f787b-e54a-4902-8212-390bb2bc7b21), in the context of the DiSSCo Flanders project (https://dissco-flanders.be/).

This project includes code from "Collective Access (providence)" -- https://github.com/collectiveaccess/providence
which is licensed under the GPL-3.0. Providence is developed by Whirl-i-Gig, Inc. and the CollectiveAccess community.

The INBO collections that will make use of this application
- The INBO soil archive (33k soil samples)
- The INBO plant analytical collection (2k dried plant samples)
- The INBO DNA collection (43k DNA samples)
- The INBO living plant collection (411 plots)
- The INBO seedbank (844 seedlots)
- The INBO stem discs (289 wood specimens)
- The INBO fish tissue collection (approx. 55 fish tissue samples)

The basic functionalities this application covers
- provide an inventory (what + where is it stored) of all the objects archived at INBO
- log re-use of objects ~ loans, both internal and external

Additional functionalities that this application could cover
- log the value of the objects so future decision making can occur without the lead scientists' involvement
- log curatorial activities that can influence the quality of the objects
