CollectiveAccess is free, open-source software for cataloguing and publishing museum and archival collections. We are currently evaluating and configuring the application for the INBO collections, in the context of the DiSSCo Flanders project (https://dissco-flanders.be/).

The INBO collections that will make use of this application
- the DNA collection (45k DNA samples)
- the soil archive (35k soil samples)
- the Genbos living plant collection (400 plots = ? woody plants)
- the Genbos seed collection (500 seed lots)
