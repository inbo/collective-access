CollectiveAccess is free, open-source software for cataloguing and publishing museum and archival collections. We are currently evaluating and configuring the application for the INBO collections (https://www.gbif.org/grscicoll/institution/df2f787b-e54a-4902-8212-390bb2bc7b21), in the context of the DiSSCo Flanders project (https://dissco-flanders.be/).

The INBO collections that will make use of this application
- the DNA collection (45k DNA samples)
- the soil archive (35k soil samples)
- the Genbos living plant collection (400 plots = ? woody plants)
- the Genbos seed collection (500 seed lots)
- the autopsy collection (??k tissue samples of mammal autopsies)

The basic functionalities this application covers
- provide an inventory (what + where is it stored) of all the objects archived at INBO
- log re-use of objects ~ loans, both internal and external

Additional functionalities that this application could cover
- log the value of the objects so future decision making can occur without the lead scientists' involvement
- log curatorial activities that can influence the quality of the objects

The INBO test is currently available here:	18.203.229.50/ca. 
The INBO specific configuration is in the INBO_profiel_XXX.xml files, currently loaded on the website is INBO_profiel_031.xml.
